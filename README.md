#Jekyll Portfolio
This a portfolio site template built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) that you can use. 

##A solid start
It uses [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) as a starting point that delivers best practices, standard elements, and pieces like Normalize.css for you to start from.

##Style it how you like
You can add custom styles in `/css/custom.css`.

###Grids
No need for a complex frontend framework. You can add in custom grids pretty easily.

* Wrap a div with the class "grid" around the content. 
* Add another div with the column you want (i.e. col-1-2 for 50% width, col-1-3 for 33% width, col-2-3 for 66% width)
```html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="col-2-3">
     Main Content
  </div>
  <div class="col-1-3">
     Sidebar
  </div>
</div>
```

##Add in your work
The portfolio projects are found in `/_posts`. There you can add the project's title, thumbnail, images, link to project, tags, categories, and summary.
